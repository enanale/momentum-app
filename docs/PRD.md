# Momentum App - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Momentum is a web application designed to help users overcome task paralysis and maintain productivity through structured task management and focused execution. The app guides users through a process of converting vague anxieties ("voids") into concrete, actionable tasks.

## Problem Statement
Knowledge workers often experience moments of being "stuck" - unable to move forward due to task overwhelm, anxiety, or lack of clarity. This leads to:
- Reduced productivity
- Increased stress
- Poor task prioritization
- Difficulty maintaining momentum

## Solution
Momentum provides a streamlined workflow that helps users:
1. Capture and process moments of being "stuck"
2. Convert unclear anxieties into concrete next actions
3. Focus on executing one task at a time
4. Maintain a clear view of daily priorities

## Target Users
- Knowledge workers
- Professionals who manage their own tasks
- Anyone who experiences task paralysis or overwhelm
- Users who want a minimalist, focused productivity tool
